One of my unrealized obsessions is fine arts.
I was so busy with coding that I didn't even do the web design.
One of the reasons why I've created this blog, was to play with colors and UI.. in a long run.

But I didn't want to start from scratch, because I could forget my initial goal - start blogging.
So, I looked for some CSS bootstrapping.
Twitter's awesome [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) and Zurb's <abbr title="cool in Azerbaijani">zor</abbr> [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) wouldn't work for me, because they are too full.

I was looking for something minimal and pure CSS. Here it is, I am using [Pure](http://purecss.io/) by Yahoo! I grabbed their [blog layout](http://purecss.io/layouts/) and now I am good to go.
