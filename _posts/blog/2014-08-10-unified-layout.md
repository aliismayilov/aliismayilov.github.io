I used to manage 2 personal websites. One as a personal page vCard. Resume, portfolio and contacts. Another one as a blog.

It didn't make sense to have 2 websites, 2 repos and one domain. The purpose was only one, to promote myself :sunglasses:

Yesterday I bought a template from [themeforest.net](http://themeforest.net). Which included blog and personal page layouts.

I highly recommend to take a look at themeforest to find a good templates for a different purposes.

Now I have 1 domain, 1 repo and 1 website. Profit!
