So, this is my n<sup>th</sup> attempt to start a real blogging. It is weekend, and it sounds very like a diet starting. If I can push it to the next weekends, I'll keep it playing.

On this blog, I'm going to write my opinions about things, post or re-post dev and tech enthusiast tutorials.

Right now, I'm writing this post on my local machine, I hope to get it live by this week.

I have an intention to create a private hub on internet, and keep my data to personal. I will use a VPS to host my owncloud, firefox sync server, maybe mail (not decided yet...).

At least, I have some topics to cover in upcoming weeks. See you soon!
